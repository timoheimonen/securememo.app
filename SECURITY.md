# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in securememo.app, please report it responsibly. I appreciate your efforts to disclose issues in a way that allows me to address them promptly.

## How to Report

- **Email**: Send details to timo.heimonen@gmail.com. Use a descriptive subject line like "Security Vulnerability Report".
- **GitHub Issues**: For non-sensitive issues, open a private issue in the repository if available, or use the email method.
- **Response Time**: I aim to acknowledge reports as soon as possible and provide updates on progress.

## What to Include in Your Report

- A clear description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Potential impact (e.g., data exposure, denial of service).
- Any proof-of-concept code or exploits (do not test on production without permission).
- Your contact information for follow-up.

**Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until I've had a chance to investigate and mitigate it.** I follow responsible disclosure practices and will credit you in any public announcements if desired.

## Supported Versions

securememo.app is a Cloudflare Workers-based project. I support the latest version of the codebase. Report issues against the current main branch.

## Security Features and Best Practices

For details on my security implementation, refer to the README.md section. I employ client-side encryption, strict security headers, input sanitization, and automated cleanup to protect user data.

## Bug Bounty

Currently, I do not offer a formal bug bounty program.

## Policy Updates

This policy may be updated periodically. Check back for changes.
